## :warning: Attention
The following commands are executed with root privileges, if the prompt `Permission denied` appears, you need to switch to root privileges, or add `sudo` at the top of these commands.

## ‚öô System configuration
### System requirements
- Linux 64-bit Intel/AMD

### Install application tools

For the Debian and  ubuntu families of linux systems:

```shell
apt install git curl wget vim util-linux -y
```

For the Fedora, RedHat and CentOS families of linux systems:

```
yum install git curl wget vim util-linux -y
```

### Firewall configuration

Deoss defaults to listening on port `8080`.  The reference for configuring firewall open ports is as follows:

#### ufw
For hosts with ufw enabled (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.), you can use the ufw command to allow traffic to flow to specific ports. Use the following command to allow access to a port:
```
ufw allow 8080
```

#### firewall-cmd
For hosts with firewall-cmd enabled (CentOS), you can use the firewall-cmd command to allow traffic on specific ports. Use the following command to allow access to a port:
```
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```
This command gets the active zone(s). Now, apply port rules to the relevant zones returned above. For example if the zone is public, use
```
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
```
Note that permanent makes sure the rules are persistent across firewall start, restart or reload. Finally reload the firewall for changes to take effect.
```
firewall-cmd --reload
```

#### iptables
For hosts with iptables enabled (RHEL, CentOS, etc.), you can use the iptables command to enable all traffic to a specific port. Use the following command to allow access to a port:
```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
service iptables restart
```

## üèó Get the binary program
### Method one
Download the latest release code directly atÔºö [Releases](https://github.com/CESSProject/DeOSS/releases)

### Method two
Compile the binary program from the DeOSS source code and follow the process as follows:

**1) install go**

DeOSS requires [Go 1.21](https://golang.org/dl/), See the [official Golang installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Open go mod mode:
```
go env -w GO111MODULE="on"
```

Users in China can add go proxy to speed up the download:
```
go env -w GOPROXY="https://goproxy.cn,direct"
```

**2) clone code**
```
git clone https://github.com/CESSProject/DeOSS.git
```

**3) compile code**
```
cd DeOSS/
go build -o deoss cmd/main.go
```

**4) Grant execute permission**

```shell
chmod +x deoss
```

## üí∞ Configure Wallet

### Step 1: create a wallet account
The wallet is your unique identity in the cess network, it allows you to do transactions with the cess chain, provided that you have some balance in your wallet.

Please refer to [Create-CESS-Wallet](https://github.com/CESSProject/cess/wiki/Create-a-CESS-Wallet) to create your cess wallet.

### Step 2: Recharge your wallet

If you are using the test network, Please join the [CESS discord](https://discord.gg/mYHTMfBwNS) to get it for free. If you are using the official network, please buy CESS tokens.

## Configuration file

Use `deoss` to generate configuration file templates directly in the current directory:
```shell
./deoss config
```
The contents of the configuration file template are as follows. The contents inside are the defaults and you will need to modify them as appropriate. By default, `deoss` uses `conf.yaml` in the current directory as the runtime configuration file. You can use `-c` or `-config` to specify the location of the configuration file.

```yaml
application:
  # gateway's workspace
  workspace: /
  # gateway run mode  [debug | release]
  mode: release
  # service visibility: [public | private]
  # public: gateway address will be published on the chain
  # private: gateway address will not be made public on the chain
  visibility: public
  # domain name, if it's empty and the visibility is public, the <ip:port> will be published on the chain
  domainname: 
  # maximum space occupied, gateway will automatically clean up the cached files
  maxusespace: 1099511627776
  # gateway API communication port, default is 8080
  port: 8080

chain:
  # signature account mnemonic
  mnemonic: ""
  # waiting for transaction timeout, default is 15 seconds
  timeout: 15
  # rpc endpoint list
  rpc:
    # test network
    - "wss://testnet-rpc.cess.network/ws/"

user:
  # high priority accounts will not be restricted or blacklisted when accessing the gateway
  account:

access:
  # access mode: [public | private]
  # public: only users in account can't access the gateway
  # private: only users in account can access the gateway
  mode: public
  # account black/white list
  account:

shunt:
  # specify the storage miner account you want to store
  account:
```

## üü¢ Usage for DeOSS
###  start deoss service
Backend operation mode (the default configuration file is in the current directory):
```shell
nohup ./deoss run 2>&1 &
```

### view deoss status
```
./deoss stat
+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| role              | deoss                                                |
| signature account | cXjy16zpi3kFU6ThDHeTifpwHop4YjaF3EvYipTeJSbTjmayP    |
| domain name       | https://deoss-sv.cess.network                        |
