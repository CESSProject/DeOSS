CESS-OSS is a service that using REST API specification for accessing CESS cloud storage.


## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find out any system bugs or you have a better suggestions, Please send an email to frode@cess.one,
we are happy to communicate with you.


## System Requirements
- Linux-amd64


## Build from source

### Step 1: Install common libraries

Take the ubuntu distribution as an example:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo upgrade
sudo apt install make gcc git curl wget vim util-linux -y
```

### Step 2: Install go locale

CESS-Gateway requires [Go1.19](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher.
> See the [official Golang installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) If you get stuck in the following process.

- Download go1.19 compress the package and extract it to the /use/local directory:

```shell
sudo wget -c https://golang.org/dl/go1.19.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local
```

- You'll need to add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your path. For most Linux distributions you can run something like:

```shell
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

- View your go version:

```shell
go version
```

### Step 3: Build a oss

```
git clone https://github.com/CESSProject/cess-oss.git
cd cess-oss/
go build -o oss cmd/main.go
```
If all goes well, you will get a program called `oss`.

## Get started with gateway

### Step 1: Register a polka wallet

Browser access: [App](https://testnet-rpc.cess.cloud/explorer) implemented by [CESS Explorer](https://github.com/CESSProject/cess-explorer), and [add an account](https://github.com/CESSProject/W3F-illustration/blob/main/gateway/createAccount.PNG).

### Step 2: Recharge your polka wallet

If you are using the test network, Please join the [CESS discord](https://discord.gg/mYHTMfBwNS) to get it for free. If you are using the official network, please buy CESS tokens.

### Step 3: Prepare configuration file

Use `oss` to generate configuration file templates directly in the current directory:
```shell
sudo chmod +x oss
./oss profile
```
The content of the configuration file template is as follows. You need to fill in your own information into the file. By default, the `oss` uses conf.toml in the current directory as the runtime configuration file. You can use `-c` or `--config` to specify the configuration file Location.

```toml
# The rpc address of the chain node
RpcAddr     = ""
# The IP address of the machine's public network used by the scheduler program
ServiceAddr = ""
# Port number monitored by the scheduler program
ServicePort = ""
# Data storage directory
DataDir     = ""
# Phrase or seed of wallet account
AccountSeed = ""
```
*Our testnet rpc address is as follows:*<br>
`wss://testnet-rpc0.cess.cloud/ws/`<br>
`wss://testnet-rpc1.cess.cloud/ws/`


## Other usage guidelines for oss
### Update the OSS address
```
./oss update <ip> <port>
```

### View the OSS address
```
./oss state
```


# Usage for oss API

The public API endpoint URL of CESS-OSS is the server you deploy, All endpoints described in this document should be made relative to this root URL,The following example uses URL instead.

## Authentication

The CESS-OSS API uses bearer tokens to authenticate requests. 

Your tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your *secret tokens* in publicly accessible locations such as a GitHub repository, client-side code, and so forth.

The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the `Authorization` header when making requests to protected resources:

| Authorization: token  |
| --------------------- |


## Get token

| **POST** /auth |
| -------------- |

The authorization interface is used to generate user tokens.

The user uploads his own email address and a captcha (the captcha should be written as 0 when uploading for the first time). If the email address is not authorized, CESS-Gateway will send a captcha to the mailbox. After the user gets the captcha in the mailbox, upload it again. CESS-Gateway generates a token for it and sends it to the mailbox，the validity of the token is 30 days.

If the mailbox uploaded by the user has been authorized, CESS-Gateway will check whether its token has expired. If it expires, CESS-Gateway will generate a new token and send it to its mailbox.
